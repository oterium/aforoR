\title{Extract Main Contour from Binarized Image}
\usage{
extract_contour(binary_image)
}
\arguments{
\item{binary_image}{A binarized image produced by \code{preprocess_image()}.}
}
\value{
A matrix of (X, Y) coordinates of the main contour, or NULL if no
        suitable contour is found.
}
\description{
Detects all contours in a binary image and identifies the largest one that meets
specific size criteria (points > 200 and area > 5000), typically representing
the fish otolith.
}
\examples{
# Process sample image and extract its contour
image_path <- system.file("extdata", "otolith.jpg", package = "aforoR")
binary_img <- preprocess_image(image_path)
contour <- extract_contour(binary_img)
head(contour)
}
