\title{Compute Perimeter Distances (Curvilinear Resampling)}
\usage{
dper(x, y, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of x-coordinates.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of y-coordinates.}

\item{n}{Number of points to sample along the perimeter.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{dist}: Radial distances from the centroid to the sampled points.
    \item \code{coords}: Coordinates of the sampled points.
  }
}
\description{
Calculates distances from the centroid to points sampled at regular intervals
along the perimeter of the shape. This provides an alternative to polar sampling
for shapes with complex bounds.

# Example using sample data
image_path <- system.file("extdata", "otolith.jpg", package = "aforoR")
contour <- extract_contour(preprocess_image(image_path))
perim_dists <- dper(contour[, 1], contour[, 2], n = 512)
plot(perim_dists$dist, type = "l", main = "Perimeter-based Distances")
