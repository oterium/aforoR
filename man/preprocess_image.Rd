\title{Preprocess Image for Contour Analysis}
\usage{
preprocess_image(image_path, threshold = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{image_path}{A string specifying the path to the image file (e.g., .jpg).}

\item{threshold}{A numeric value (0-1) for binarization. If NULL, Otsu's method
is automatically applied.}
}
\value{
A \code{pixset} (EBImage) representing the binarized image.
}
\description{
Prepares an image for shape analysis by applying grayscale conversion,
Gaussian smoothing to reduce noise, and binarization using the Otsu method (default)
or a fixed threshold.
}
\examples{
# Use the sample otolith image included in the package
image_path <- system.file("extdata", "otolith.jpg", package = "aforoR")
processed_img <- preprocess_image(image_path)
# display(processed_img) # if using EBImage
}
